# Average output size of hypercube-wise aggregated CP-Nets

This notebook explores the average output size of aggregated CP-Nets with Hypercubewise Aggregation [1] (in contrast to the worst case size).
For that randomly generated CP-Nets were utilized, generated with https://github.com/nmattei/GenCPNet.  
The CP-Nets are contained in the CPNets directory in XML format.  

Naming example:  
"n10c5d2" means the contained CPNet has 10 variables, each node has maximally 5 parents  and each variable has a binary domain.
